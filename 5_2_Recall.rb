Start with the array
people = [
  ["Bruce", "Wayne", "Batman"], 
  ["Selina", "Kyle", "Catwoman"], 
  ["Barbara", "Gordon", "Oracle"], 
  ["Terry", "McGinnis", "Batman Beyond"]
]
Use a times loop to print out each person on separate lines with their alter egos. The result should be:
Bruce Wayne, a.k.a. Batman
Selina Kyle, a.k.a. Catwoman
Barbara Gordon, a.k.a. Oracle
Terry McGinnis, a.k.a. Batman Beyond


index = 0

4.times do 
	puts  " #{people[index][0]}" +  " #{people[index][1]}," " a.k.a." + " #{people[index][2]}"
	index = index + 1
	end
