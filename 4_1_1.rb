	def title

	def artist 
		return "Frank Sinatra"
	end 

	def lyrics 
		return "My funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine
				You make me smile with my heart
				Your looks are laughable
				Unphotographable
				Yet you're my favorite work of art 
				Is your figure less than Greek? 
				Is your mouth a little weak? 
				When you open it to speak
				Are you smart? 
				But don't change a hair for me
				Not if you care for me
				Stay little Valentine, stay 
				Each day is Valentine's Day"
	end 

end
